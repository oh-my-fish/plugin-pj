#### pj
A port of [Jan De Poorter's pj][jdp-pj] for the fish shell. `pj` was originally
popularized by the oh-my-zsh plugin with the same name, [pj][omz-pj].

`pj` allows you to easily jump between your favourite directories in
a predictable manner. You tell `pj` where to look for your projects, and it will
allow you to jump to them easily with tab completion. It even provides
a convenient ability to open an editor in that directory from anywhere!

## Install

```fish
$ omf install pj
```


## Configuration

In order to tell `pj` where to look for your projects, you need to set an
environment variable called `PROJECT_PATHS`. It is a list of directories which
contain your projects.

```fish
$ set -gx PROJECT_PATHS ~/workspace ~/src
```


## Usage

To jump to a project, simply run `pj` with the name of the directory you would
like to jump to.

```fish
$ pj foo-project
```

You can also open it in your favourite editor with the `pj open` command. This
will open the project with the `$EDITOR` configured on your system.

```fish
$ pj open foo-project
```

Print work directory of project.

```fish
$ pj pwd foo-project

# abbr example: Execute project scripts anywhere
$ abbr foo 'pushd (pj pwd foo-project)/path/to/script; foo-command; popd'
```

Protip: You can set an abbrebiation in your shell for the above, like `pjo`.

```fish
$ abbr -a pjo pj open
$ pjo<space>
# Becomes
$ pj open
```
